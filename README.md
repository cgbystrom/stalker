# Stalker

Stalker is a small library and browser extension that enables you to introspect traces
generated by an HTTP server.

It is intended to quickly help you introspect/gain understanding of what your application
is doing. 

Examples of things that are useful to instrument:
memcached calls, SQL queries, template rendering times and calls to third party services.
